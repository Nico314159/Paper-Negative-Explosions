Paper-Negative-Explosions
===========

Paper fork that allows negative explosion radius creepers to function as they do in vanilla. Will try to keep updated with regular paper. DM me on Discord at Nicoder#6884 if you have issues.

Compiling
------
Compiling this fork of Paper works identically to compiling Paper normally. All you need is JDK 17 and an internet connection.

Clone this repo, run `./gradlew applyPatches`, then `./gradlew createReobfBundlerJar` from your terminal. You can find the compiled jar in the project root's `build/libs` directory.

To get a full list of tasks, run `./gradlew tasks`.
